# Woo-Product-Variation-Scraper
Scrapes Woocommerce store and gets Product details and variations.

This is a Python scraper to scrape product information from a Specific WooCommerce store. 

This scrapes the information I needed so it doesnt have fields such as price, as I did not need this information. 

However I needed the variations and variations details. 

This will not work on every WooCommerce store due to the selectors. The selectors can however be changed to suit a different WooCommerce store.
